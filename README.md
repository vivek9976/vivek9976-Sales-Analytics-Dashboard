## Code Overview

The primary logic is contained within the `SalesDashboard.tsx` component.

-   **State Management**: Utilizes React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`) to manage component state, including view modes, time ranges, and dynamically generated mock data.
-   **Data Visualization**: Leverages `Recharts` for creating the area and pie charts, with custom tooltips for an enhanced user experience.
-   **Animations & UX**: `Framer Motion` is used extensively for page load animations, card transitions, and interactive feedback, creating a polished and responsive feel.
-   **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS` is used for all styling, enabling a consistent and maintainable design system directly within the markup.
